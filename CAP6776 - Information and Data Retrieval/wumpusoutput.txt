@help gcl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcl - Runs a standard GCL query against the data in the index.

For a thorough description of the GCL query language, have a look at
Clarke et al., "An Algebra for Structured Text Search and a Framework for
its Implementation". The Computer Journal, 38(1):43-56, 1995.
@gcl is the standard query type. That is, if unspecified, @gcl is assumed.

Examples:

  @gcl[get][count=3] ("because"^"of")<[5]
  1158 1161 "because the window of"
  1569 1573 "of R.H. Macy because"
  1573 1574 "because of"

Operators supported:

  "^" (Boolean AND), "+" (Boolean OR), ">" (CONTAINS),
  "/>" (DOES-NOT-CONTAIN), "<" (CONTAINED-IN), "/<" (NOT-CONTAINED-IN),
  ".." (FOLLOWED-BY), [N] (window of N char's), N (absolute index address)

In addition to the canonical GCL operators, Wumpus also understands extended
restrictions based on file-related meta-data, for example:

  {filetype=text/xml} matches all files of type text/xml
  {filesize > 100000} matches all files bigger than 100,000 bytes
  {filepath=/home/wumpus/*} matches all files below the given directory
  "<file!>" returns the start offset of all visible files
  "</file!>" returns the end offset of all visible files

Query modifiers supported:

  boolean get (default: false)
    returns the text at each matching index position
  boolean filtered (default: false)
    to be used in conjunction with [get]: does not return the original text,
    but the text after being run through Wumpus' input tokenizer
  boolean getxpath (default: false)
    prints an XPath expression for each given index position returned; only
    works if the ENABLE_XPATH configuration variable was set when building
    the index
  For further modifiers, see "@help query".
